               ****How to use the website *****
**************************************************************
1. Please visit http://18.188.125.18/JobRecommendation/ to test its functionality. 
2. Register an account with your own username and password, and then go back to the main page.
3. Login with the current username and password.
4. The website will return the nearby recommended items with a default keyword of "engineer'
5. Click the 'heart' icon on the right side of some items as 'favorited items', and you may see the saved result under 'My Favorites' page.
6. Under 'Recommendation' page, the website will return the recommendation items based on the content saved under the 'My Favorite' page.
7. You are all done!

Note: If you cannot see the content under the 'nearby' page, it's probably because the freed MonkeyLearn API used in the project throttles and 
      thus cannot return the results. Normally this happens at the end of the month, and you may try it at the beginning of the month :)
